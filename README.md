# Spring Boot TOTP Demo

This project is a demonstration of implementing Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) authentication using Spring Boot.
This demo app is tested with Google Authenticator only.

## Features

- Generate QR codes for TOTP setup
- Validate TOTP codes
- Secure authentication mechanism

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.8 or higher

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:kevin-fabian/springboot-playground-totp.git
   cd springboot-playground-totp

## How to Use?
1. There are two APIs in this project:
   - `/api/totp/qr` For generating QR codes for TOTP setup(I use Google Authenticator)
   - `/api/totp/verification` for verifying TOTP codes
2. Download the Google Authenticator app on your mobile device.
3. Scan the QR code generated by the `/api/totp/qr` endpoint using the Google Authenticator app.
4. Use the app to generate TOTP codes and verify them using the `/api/totp/verification` endpoint.
